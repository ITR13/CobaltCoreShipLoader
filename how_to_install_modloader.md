# Installing modloader
Download the top zip file of the latest release at: [https://github.com/Ewanderer/CobaltCoreModLoader/releases](https://github.com/Ewanderer/CobaltCoreModLoader/releases)  
![Website above with Assets expanded on a release and "CobaltCoreModLauncher.zip" highlighted](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ITR13/CobaltCoreShipLoader/main/.readme/modloader_git.png)
Inside the zip is a folder, extract this to somewhere.  
![If your path has ".zip" in it, then you haven't extracted it yet.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ITR13/CobaltCoreShipLoader/main/.readme/modloader_zip.png)  
Create a new "ModLibrary" folder, and put your downloaded mod in it. Make sure the dll from the mod has the same name as the folder it's in.  
![ITRsShipLoader.dll is inside CobaltCoreModLauncher/ModLibrary/ITRsShipLoader](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ITR13/CobaltCoreShipLoader/main/.readme/modloader_folder.png)  
Go into the extracted folder and sort by "type", and open "CobaltCoreModLoaderApp.exe"  
![Folder is sorted with type ascending, run CobaltCoreModLoaderApp.exe](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ITR13/CobaltCoreShipLoader/main/.readme/modloader_exe.png)  
When the program opens, click Locate Game. Then click "Load Folder" and select the "ModLibrary" folder you added before. Once all the mods you installed show up in the list, press "**Launch Cobalt Core**"
